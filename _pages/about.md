Hi! Thanks for visiting my humble little blog. Here I post about my interests, mainly professional but occasionally will extra-curricular activities.
</p>
<p>
I have loved math and data since as far as I can remember. In elementary school, I would stay awake at night and study sports encyclopedias and farmers' almanacs.
</p>
<p>
When I first went to college, I planned on becoming a sports writer. I didnâ€™t sustain the passion and took 2 years off making a living bartending. After a chance conversation while working, I learned about actuarial science: the bookies of the insurance world. So I decided that's what I was going to do.
</p>
<p>
I graduated with my BA in Math with a concentration in actuarial science and passed 2 exams before graduation. 2009 was a tough year to enter the workforce, but I was lucky enough to land a job in an accelerated developmental program at Genworth in Richmond, VA. I spent over 7 years there and after years of late nights studying, I passed all of the required exams and earned my Fellowship in the  Society of Actuaries (FSA) and Chartered Enterprise Risk Analyst (CERA).
</p>
<p>
As the field emerged, I decided to specialize in machine learning and big data and stated taking courses while working full-time to earn my MS in Statistics, graduating in 2016 (DS, ML, and AI degrees were still not very common). I then pivoted my career to focus on machine learning and data science.
</p>
<p>
I love using machine learning and predictive modeling to build things. I have a wide range of interests: LLMs, deep learning, MCMC, Bayesian modeling, database management, MLOps, stochastic modeling, LLMs, computer vision, A/B testing, causal modeling, ETL...
</p>
<p>
I spent ten years in health and insurance, becoming a subject matter expert in risk management and mortality. The last few years I have moved away from insurance and to modern tech: working for SAS and social media (Instagram).
</p>

Outside of work I am a die-hard Denver Broncos fan. I live in Portland, OR with my partner and our dog. I started home-labbing during the beginning of the pandemic and slowly have found self-hosting addicting. I spend my weekends and days off exploring the wonders of the Pacific Northwest. I trail run, snowboard, hike, backpack, rock climb, camp, and have dabbled in other activities. I have completed 6 marathons, including 2 sub 3-hour finishes. Always looking for the next adventure!
