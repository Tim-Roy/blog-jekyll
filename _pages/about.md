Hi! Welcome to my humble little blog, where I share my thoughts and interests. Most of my posts focus on professional topics, but I occasionally post about extracurricular activities.
</p>
<p>
I've been passionate about math and data for as long as I can remember. As a kid, I would stay up late studying sports encyclopedias and farmers' almanacs.
</p>
<p>
When I first went to college, I had plans to become a sports writer. However, my passion didn't sustain, and I took two years off to make a living bartending. A chance conversation during that time introduced me to actuarial science — essentially the "bookies" of the insurance world — and I decided to head down that path.
</p>
<p>
I earned my BA in Mathematics with a concentration in actuarial science, passing two actuarial exams before graduation. 2009 was a rough year to enter the workforce, but I was fortunate to secure a position in an accelerated development program at Genworth Insurance in Richmond, VA. Over the next seven years, I dedicated myself to late-night study sessions, eventually earning my Fellowship in the Society of Actuaries (FSA) and becoming a Chartered Enterprise Risk Analyst (CERA).

As machine learning and big data began to grow and enter my purview, I opted to specialize in these areas. While working full-time, I pursued and completed an MS in Statistics in 2016—before dedicated degrees in data science, machine learning, and AI were commonplace. This pivot allowed me to transition my career to focus on machine learning and data science.
</p>
<p>
I have a deep passion for building things with machine learning and predictive modeling. My interests span a broad spectrum, including LLMs, deep learning, MCMC, Bayesian modeling, database management, MLOps, stochastic modeling, computer vision, A/B testing, causal modeling, and ETL, to name a few.
</p>
<p>
I spent a decade in the health and insurance industries, where I became a subject matter expert in risk management and mortality. In recent years, I transitioned to modern tech, working in SAS, social media at Instagram, and now in AI research.

Outside of work, I’m a die-hard Denver Broncos fan. I live in Portland, OR, with my partner and our dog. During the pandemic, I discovered home-labbing, which quickly became an addicting hobby. On weekends and days off, I explore the wonders of the Pacific Northwest. I enjoy trail running, snowboarding, hiking, backpacking, rock climbing, and camping—and I’ve dabbled in many other outdoor activities. I’ve also completed six marathons, including two sub-3-hour finishes. I’m always keeping an for my next adventure!
